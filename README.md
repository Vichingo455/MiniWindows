Mini11 is a lightweight Windows 11 by the MiniWindows Team, which doesn't contain a huge amount of Microsoft's bloatware. It also doesn't require the obscenely high system requirements. This 22H2 release is built on the Windows 11 2022 Update, otherwise known as Windows 11 version 22H2. And now there are three editions for users to pick from:
- Mini11 offers the purest Windows 11 experience yet and is recommended for older hardware.
- Mini11 GX is designed for gaming with an emphasis on lower delays and higher frame rates.
- Mini11 Legacy offers an upgraded version of the 21H2 RTM experience.

It can run on 256MB of RAM and can take up as little as 4GB of drive space - it can even be installed on 8GB drives*. Users can even upgrade to it as it supports in-place upgrading, and can install it on a USB flash drive**.

<p>* As tested on Mini11 and Mini11 GX. Mini11 Legacy is slightly larger than 8 GB.

** Installing Mini11 on a USB flash drive (known as Mini11 To Go) requires using Rufus. This feature is confirmed to exist on Mini11 and Mini11 Legacy.</p>
